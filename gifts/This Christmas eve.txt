On this fine night of Christmas eve, 
Upon this night I shall gift to thee, 
Many wondrous things that you shall see,
All these for you under the tree.
Pyrrhas and Ã‰clairs and dark gods and more, 
these many things shall be in store.
But that's not all, 
Oh yes, there's more!!
This night here's something you might desire,
I shall tell you the name I have come to aquire.
