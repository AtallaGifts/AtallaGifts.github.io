On this 4th day I now shall write, poem about 4 young girls who have seen such plight.

Within this world of Grimm and men,
There stand four kingdoms, proud and strong

Atlas, where dull metal shines.
Once free, now ready for war.
It takes an army,
And that's all they are.

Mistral, lush and full of life,
Worships sea and sky alike.

Vacuo, lawless and dead.
Only rule there is if you can live, 
You can stay.

Vale, once safe from harm,
A Beacon of hope in days gone by,
Now lies in ruin, where many have died.

Throughout these kingdoms,
None shall see
As much pure evil
As team RWBY.
