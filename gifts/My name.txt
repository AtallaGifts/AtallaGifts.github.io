I said they'd be under the tree and here they are, 
these gifts that I have made for you,
all gathered here for you to view.
and as the witching hour comes, 
as the lights turn low and the fire hums.
These gift plus one i give to you, 
my name of course you know by now, 
this name of mine, is Mackybean.
